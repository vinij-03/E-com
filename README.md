## Problem Statement

Over 23 million artisans work in the Indian handicraft and handloom industry. A cross-border e-commerce marketplace will bring customers and sellers together on a single business platform. It will aid in the expansion of their firm as well as the overall economy of our country.
To provide a unique e-commerce platform for craftsmen to market their wares. Demand forecasting for required products, automatic quality checks on the objects, and sentiment analysis with next recommended actions for the artist will be implemented.
To globalise the Indian handicraft industry? Providing a shared platform for the creation, marketing, and sale of high-quality handicrafts and items.

## Solution Approach

We've built an ecommerce website system that focuses on buying and selling of **HANDICRAFTS & HANDLOOM**
products online.Enhancing the marketing strategy and it gives way to those people who have less time to visit the market place.
Our aim is to design a website that enhances marketing through online advertising, buying and selling.
That gives opportunity to both sellers and buyers, that will enable customer to search product online, view product description and where consumer can purchase and order products. For better compatibility and to be more consumer oriented
we'll have proper quality checks from the seller's side and
before any product is delivered to the consumers our
executives will be performing a physical overview which well
perhaps help us delivering better outsources.
And also on the basis of customer reviews we'll be further be
upgrading our DEMAND FORECASTING and Recommend
Actions for the artists, so that the user experience can be
enhanced.
- We provide our customers with effiecient amount of detals regarding the products.
- Also we are connecting the B2B to B2C because of which the buyers are able to link directly with the dealers and artisans.
